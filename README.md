# Pet Shop

### I used technologies such as: Vite, Redux, Clerk, React-router, React-router-dom, Radix, Tailwindcss, React-datepicker, React-hook-form, react-icons, React-hot-toast, Vercel.

You may test Forms by sumiting and check console to see data but I also wrote axios codes to send data to database also.

This website is about the front-end of the pet shop website that sells foods and services for pets, foods and services may change depends on real database or API. click on this Link to see the project: https://pet-shop-pi-two.vercel.app/
